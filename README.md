# Docker Practice Project

This project is designed to help you learn and practice Docker, a powerful platform for developing, shipping, and running applications inside containers. Below you'll find a comprehensive overview of Docker concepts, commands, and best practices.

## What is Docker?
Docker is an open-source platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of applications using containerization. Containers are lightweight, portable, and self-sufficient units that include everything needed to run a piece of software, including the code, runtime, libraries, and system tools.

## Key Docker Concepts

- **Image**: A read-only template with instructions for creating a Docker container. Images are built from Dockerfiles.
- **Container**: A runnable instance of an image. Containers are isolated from each other and the host system.
- **Dockerfile**: A text file with a set of instructions to build a Docker image.
- **Docker Hub**: A cloud-based registry for sharing Docker images.
- **Volume**: A mechanism for persisting data generated by and used by Docker containers.
- **Network**: Docker provides networking features to connect containers to each other and to external networks.

## Basic Docker Commands

- `docker build -t <name> .` — Build an image from a Dockerfile in the current directory.
- `docker images` — List all Docker images on your system.
- `docker run <image>` — Run a container from an image.
- `docker ps` — List running containers.
- `docker ps -a` — List all containers (running and stopped).
- `docker stop <container_id>` — Stop a running container.
- `docker rm <container_id>` — Remove a container.
- `docker rmi <image_id>` — Remove an image.
- `docker logs <container_id>` — View logs from a container.
- `docker exec -it <container_id> bash` — Run a command inside a running container (e.g., open a bash shell).

## Example Dockerfile

```
# Use an official Node.js runtime as a parent image
FROM node:18

# Set the working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy package.json and install dependencies
COPY package.json ./
RUN npm install

# Copy the rest of the application code
COPY . .

# Expose the port the app runs on
EXPOSE 3000

# Run the app
CMD ["node", "index.js"]
```

## Best Practices
- Keep images small by minimizing layers and using `.dockerignore`.
- Use official images when possible.
- Pin image versions to avoid unexpected changes.
- Use multi-stage builds for production images.
- Store persistent data in volumes.
- Clean up unused images and containers regularly.
